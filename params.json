{"name":"Planning Center Developers","tagline":"","body":"### Introduction\r\nCurrently Planning Center offers two different APIs that you can work with - a legacy API for PCO Services, and an all new API for your PCO account. Currently the new PCO API only has data from PCO People, but we are in the process of adding some of our other apps to it including Services.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started with the PCO API\r\nThe best place to get started with the PCO API is at the [PCO API Documentation](http://planningcenter.github.io/api-docs/). There is also a [Ruby gem wrapper](https://github.com/planningcenter/pco_api_ruby) around our API.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started with the PCO Services API\r\nDocumentation, examples, and getting started guides are available at [this repo](http://planningcenter.github.io/planningcenter/developers).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nIf you have any questions or run into any hiccups, please open open an issue on our [developer repo](https://github.com/planningcenter/developers/issues).\r\n\r\n### PCO :heart: Developers\r\nPlanning Center Online is a development driven company - over half of our staff are either developers or designers (designers who code!), [our owner](https://github.com/theberg) spends most of his time developing, and our developers maintain several [popular](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) [open](https://github.com/churchio) [source](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) [projects](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick) and have contributed to many others including Rails and RSpec.\r\n\r\nIf you're a like minded developer, take a look at our [careers page](http://get.planningcenteronline.com/careers).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
