          <p>Planning Center is a development driven company. Over half our staff are either developers or designers who code. Even our founder spends much of his time programming. Let’s build some stuff!</p>

            <p>There’s a single API for all of Planning Center. Our API currently interfaces with <span class="icon icon-check-in"></span>Check-Ins, and <span class="icon icon-giving"></span>Giving, <span class="icon icon-people"></span>People, <span class="icon icon-resources"></span>Resources, <span class="icon icon-services"></span>Services, with plans to add additional endpoints in the near future. It conforms to the JSON API 1.0 specification, so you need to know how to interpret, traverse, store, and manage that data type.</p>

                <h3>For Churches</h3>
                <p>Your tech team can use our API to explore and manipulate your data for a variety of purposes — like creating a church directory, compiling a song book, running custom reports, or whatever else you dream up.</p>
                <p><strong>To get started,</strong> you’ll need a login to an active Planning Center organization and a Developer Access Token. Each token has an Application ID and a Secret you can use to connect to your Planning Center account.</p>

                <h3>For App Teams</h3>
                <p>You can use our API to build an integration between your app and Planning Center — whether you have a texting app that
                wants to pull lists from People, a donations app that wants to sync payments to Giving, or anything in between.</p>
                <h4>Getting Started</h4>
                <p>You’ll need a login to an active Planning Center organization. If you don’t have one, it’s easy to create a new
                organization (using all free subscription levels if needed) and fill it with some sample data to work with. Then you can
                create and register your application.</p>
                <p><a href="https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/applications" class="btn">Register Your Application</a></p>
                <h4>When You're Done</h4>
                <p>When you’ve completed your integration, let us know! We’d like to see how it works and maybe include it
                on our <a href="https://planning.center/integrations">integration page</a>.
                Fill out a form so our team has all the information they need to review your integration.
                We’ll be in touch with a timeline for review and next steps.</p>

            <img src="./images/illustration-permissions.svg" />
            <p>The Planning Center API always acts under the permission levels of the person who has connected it. For churches, that’s the person who generates the Developer Access Token. For App Teams, it’s the person (your user) who initiates the OAuth connection from your app into Planning Center. This should probably be an <a href="https://pcoaccounts.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204462420-Organization-Administrators-Billing-Managers">organization administrator</a> (a role that has wide permissions across Planning Center) so that the app you’re building can do what it needs to do. If you plan to use the Giving part of our API, that person will need to be a <a href="https://pcogiving.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206541708-How-Permissions-Work-in-Planning-Center-Giving">Giving administrator</a> as well.</p>

          <h3>Updates</h3>
          <p>Our API is updated regularly. If we implement a potentially breaking change, we’ll send an email to third-party developers via a mailing list. You’re automatically subscribed to this list when you create an application, but you can also sign up below. For minor updates, you can <a href="https://github.com/planningcenter/api-docs/commits/gh-pages.atom">follow this RSS feed</a>.</p>

          <h3>Slack</h3>
          <p>Planning Center has a thriving customer community on Slack. The #api channel is where you’ll want to ask questions and get help with the API. Keep in mind this is a customer channel, but Planning Center developers will occasionally chime in with an answer or comment. Updates to the API are also posted here.</p>

          <h3>Bugs</h3>
          <p>If you’re a developer, you probably live on GitHub. We do too. We’ve created a repo called “Developers” which is mainly used for tracking issues with the API. There’s also a readme which explains some technical issues related to the API. This is where to go when you think you’ve run into a real problem.</p>
